            <p>A stray dog is a homeless dog that has been abandoned or born from dogs abandoned on the streets. They are often unconfined and found in cities, spending most of their days wandering through the streets and looking for food. Stray dogs can be found in public places or on the property of others when not accompanied by their owners</p>

Erich Fromm, a renowned psychoanalyst and social philosopher gave an insight into man’s irrational and brutal behaviour in his famous book, ‘The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness’.</p>
